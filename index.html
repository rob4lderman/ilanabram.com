                    You want a dog that greets people politely, plays nicely with
                    other dogs, comes when called, walks calmly on leash, and
                    listens to you as a friend. You want an eager and enthusiastic learner 
                    who <i>cannot wait</i> to train with you.

                    I use <em>force-free</em>, <em>science-based</em>, <em>positive-reinforcement</em> training.
                    When you train this way, you do more than train obedience. You and your dog 
                    learn how to communicate with one another. It is a
                    mutually beneficial partnership that will amaze you.

                    husbandry behaviors. I have formed relationships based on trust with a variety of species -
                    bobcat, parrots, monkeys, lemurs, alpacas, porcupine, fox,

                   I use force-free, positive training based on the science of Applied

                    You can train any animal with these methods.
